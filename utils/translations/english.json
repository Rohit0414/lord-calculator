  "cgpaDefinition": "CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) is a comprehensive reflection of a student’s academic performance across all semesters and subjects over a specific period. It provides a holistic view of the student’s consistent performance throughout their course.",
  "gpaDefinition": "On the other hand, GPA (Grade Point Average) is a more concise metric that evaluates a student’s performance in individual courses or subjects, often focusing on semester-specific achievements. GPA helps institutions track performance on a per-term basis.",
  "regionalUsage": "While CGPA is more commonly used in Asian countries, GPA is widely practiced in Western countries such as the United States and Europe. This difference in grading systems is why the CGPA to GPA conversion is often required, especially for international students or academic transfers.",

  "title--": "Pros. & Cons. of Using Percentage to CGPA Online Calculators",
  "pros_title": "Pros. of Percentage to CGPA Calculators",
  "pros_1": "Convert your Grades on the go. Online calculators have pre-defined values and equations. Therefore, you don’t have to worry about putting the values in the right place in the equation. Simply enter the values in the indicated field and there you go, you have your results without wasting any time or effort.",
  "pros_2": "Online calculators have interactive and simple interfaces. Additionally, visual elements like our grade meter provide better visualization of your grades.",
  "pros_3": "In traditional calculators, you need to record each and every calculated data if you want to have the history of grades calculated. Such scenarios occur when an educator needs to track the grades of students from different universities in a universal format. But on Lord Calculator, you can view the history of all the grades calculated in the tabular format below the “Result” field. Additionally, you can even export the history as a PDF and save it for any future purpose.",
  "pros_4": "Online calculators also eliminate the possibilities of human error that may occur, such as while forming equations on default calculators, or while doing the calculations manually on pen and paper.",
  "cons_title": "Cons. of Percentage to CGPA Calculators",
  "cons_1": "Varying Multiplication Factor: We have noticed that different universities follow different multiplication factors even under the same grading scale. Thus, in such scenarios online calculators cannot meet the requirements of all the universities. You have to manually modify the multiplication factor for accurate conversion.",
  "cons_2": "Different Conversion Formulae: We also have seen universities like the University of Mumbai, use altogether different formulas for CGPA to percentage conversions. For instance, the CGPA to percentage formula for the University of Mumbai is, CGPA = (Percentage - 11) / 7.25. In these cases, online calculators cannot add additional operators automatically or manually. During such conversions, you need to refer to traditional methods of calculating grades.",
  "summary_title": "To Sum It Up",
  "summary_1": "So far, we have learned about the Percentage & CGPA concepts, how to convert and use them interchangeably, what the possible situations are when you would be required to change your grades, and how different universities/boards rely on varying grading scales and conversion formulas.",
