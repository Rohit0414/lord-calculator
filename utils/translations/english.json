  "misinterpretingFormula": "Misinterpreting the Formula:",
  "misinterpretingFormulaDesc": "Some students mistakenly interpret the formula by using the wrong multiplier, for example, using 10 instead of 9.5. It’s crucial to understand that even though various universities may use the same grading scale, they might apply different multiplication factors for CGPA to percentage or percentage to CGPA conversion. For example, CBSE, ICSE, Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University (JNTU), and Savitribai Phule University (SPPU) all use a 10-point grading scale, but each has its own multiplication factor. CBSE uses 9.5, ICSE uses 9.8, JNTU uses 10, and SPPU uses 6.3. So, it's important to know the exact multiplication factor for your board or university to avoid errors, even when using online CGPA calculators.",
  "notKnowingBoardsFormula": "Not Knowing the Board's Formula:",
  "notKnowingBoardsFormulaDesc": "Another common pitfall is being unaware that different universities use different formulas. As mentioned earlier, JNTU or SPPU apply multiplication factors directly to convert CGPA to percentage. However, universities like the University of Mumbai or Gujarat Technological University (GTU) use a different approach. They first multiply the CGPA by a specific multiplication factor (7.25 for Mumbai University or 7.1 for GTU) and then add a fixed value (11 for Mumbai University or 12 for GTU) to the product to determine the percentage. We will discuss these conversion factors for different universities and boards in a later section of this article.",
  "overRelianceOnCalculators": "Over-reliance on Online CGPA Calculators:",
  "overRelianceOnCalculatorsDesc": "While online calculators offer a quick and reliable solution for grade conversion, they are not always 100% accurate. Online calculators may not account for all the special cases we discussed, such as those for Mumbai University or GTU. While LordCalculator strives to include all possible parameters, it’s not recommended to rely solely on online calculators for conversions. It’s always a good idea to double-check your values and the method used by your university or board.",

    {
      "title": "Increased Peer/Social Pressure",
      "description": "Precise scales such as percentages can increase peer or social pressure among students, while broader scales such as Letter Grading can result in reduced pressure. This is also one of many reasons that several institutions follow broader scales, especially for lower classes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Career Opportunities",
      "description": "Career opportunities might also be affected. Varying grading scales can increase difficulties for students to get their applications passed for scholarships, admissions, and even jobs. Recently, there was a case with a friend of mine where his job application was put on hold because the board from which he had done matriculation did not provide any additional certificate mentioning the percentage. Instead, they only provide a marksheet with precise marks. However, the candidate was alleged to have the passing certificate lost even though he didn't have any in the first case."
    },
    {
      "title": "Academic Prospect",
      "description": "Varying grading scales can also impact the prospects of students in academic life. One student studying under a precise grading system will have a different mindset about the examinations than a student studying under a broader grading system. Former students might focus more on exams, while later students might prioritize working on practical projects over exams, thus having better practical knowledge. Such variations can fuel unnecessary pressure on the students."
