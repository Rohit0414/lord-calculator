                <h1>GPA to CGPA Calculator</h1>
                <p>Welcome to another educational calculator! In the corresponding calculators, we calculated <a href="/cgpa-to-percentage">CGPA to Percentage</a> (and vice-versa). Also, we learned certain concepts related to these grade scales and scenarios where we use conversion. If we look at trends, most of the Asian and certain African countries follow CGPA or Percentage system. However, the Western education system uses GPA and the <a href="/letter-grading">Letter Grading</a> system.</p>

                <p>When you migrate from one institution to another, both following different grading systems, you need to have a reliable Grade conversion calculator in your hand. In such cases, you can count on Lord Calculator's GPA to CGPA calculator. As per international standards, we follow the most commonly used formula for the conversion.</p>

                <p>Well, in this guide, we will discuss the formula used, scenarios where you might need this particular(CGPA to GPA) conversion, precautions, and imp. points you should keep in MIND while doing such conversions.</p>

                <h2>GPA To CGPA Calculation Formula</h2>
                <p><strong>Equivalent CGPA = GPA obtained * Max. CGPA / Max. GPA</strong></p>

                <h3>How to Calculate GPA?</h3>
                <p>GPA = Total Quality Points for all terms / Total Credit Hours for all terms.</p>
                <p>Where, Quality Points for a Term = Point Value of Letter Grade * Number of Credit Hours.</p>

                <h3>How to Use Lord Calculator’s GPA to CGPA Calculator?</h3>
                <p>Although we have made our calculator easy to use, still here is a guide to make the best out of it without losing yourself in the numerators and denominators of the grades calculations.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Step 1: Open GPA to CGPA calculator on Lord Calculator.</li>
                    <li>Step 2: In the very first field, titled "Enter GPA", please enter your obtained GPA accurately. Do ensure to include decimal points for accurate conversion.</li>
                    <li>Step 3: Now choose your GPA Scale. This scale also indicates what could be the maximum GPA.</li>
                    <li>Step 4: Once you have entered all the values correctly, hit the “Calculate” button.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>And, that is all! Now you have an equivalent CGPA in front of view, also visualized by the CGPA meter. Furthermore, you can also view any previous calculations done by you so that you can have a start comparison among them. You can also export the converted CGPA as a PDF and share it with others.</p>

                <h2>How CGPA & GPA Are Different?</h2>
                <p>CGPA & GPA are different from many perspectives. <a href="/definition">Definition of both the terms</a> itself indicates the basic difference between them. But let us talk about how they are different in their applications and usage.</p>

                <h3>Denomination</h3>
                <p>As the name suggests, CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) represents the cumulative or combined performance of a student during his academic session. It usually represents the performance of multiple semesters in a concise manner.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, GPA (Grade Point Average) represents the academic performance of a particular semester, or say, a very specific term/semester. Thus, in a way, CGPA is calculated by averaging the GPA scores from multiple semesters.</p>

                <h3>Usage</h3>
                <p>Like denomination, the usage of both scales is also different. CGPA is considered as overall academic performance of a student while GPA is considered for a specific semester or term.</p>
                <p>GPA is mostly used to assess and chart out how a student is performing lately and helps to identify strong points and potential improvement areas. Such grade scales are also used to determine what are the implications of a newly inducted course on the academic performance of the students. But if we talk about applying for a job or higher studies, GPA may not be the ideal grade scale.</p>
                <p>In such scenarios, when a student is applying for higher studies or a job application, he/she is required to fill in his CGPA. Thus, CGPA is shared with external bodies while GPA is mostly used in the internal assessment.</p>

                <h3>To summarize, take a look at the below-given table:</h3>
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>

                        </tr>

                <h2>International Standards and Certifications</h2>
                <p>As we talked about at the beginning of this article grading scales like GPA are more of a Western educational concept. Let us learn more about certain international standards and certifications that every student should refer to if he/she is planning to study abroad.</p>

                <h3>International Baccalaureate</h3>
                <p>This educational framework is used for standardized assessments of students aged 3 to 19. It is designed to emphasize critical thinking, intercultural understanding, and international compatibility. IB framework is divided into 4 types of programs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Primary Years Programme</li>
                    <li>Middle Years Programme</li>
                    <li>Diploma Programme (1-7 grading scale)</li>
                    <li>Career-related Programme</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Common Core State Standards (CCSS)</h3>
                <p>CCSS concept is developed by the U.S. to standardize K-12 education in mathematics and the English language. It is mainly practiced in the United States. This framework mainly focuses on providing clear benchmarks for academic achievement and preparing students for global competitiveness.</p>

                <h3>Bologna Process or European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS)</h3>
                <p>The Bologna Process is more like an agreement among the European countries to standardize higher education. It makes students of E.U. transfer across various institutions. This framework uses Letter Grading to determine the academic performance of a student. 1 ECTS credit usually means 25-30 hours of study. Its grading scale ranges between A to F where F represents failure.</p>

                <h3>Advanced Placement Program</h3>
                <p>Like CCSS, the Advanced Placement framework is also practiced in the USA. It is followed by the College Boards or Universities. It follows a number grading system from 1 to 5, in which 3 is considered as passing. Courses covered under AP are equivalent to first-year college courses and all of them are recognized internationally.</p>

                <h3>International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE)</h3>
                <p>IGCSE is developed by Cambridge Assessment International Education. This framework uses a grading scale between A to G, with U representing failure.</p>

                <h3>Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA)</h3>
                <p>TEQSA framework is primarily followed in Australia. It covers higher education and also aligns with the Australian Qualifications Framework. Although, this framework is majorly followed in Australia only it is internationally recognized ensuring the global mobility of students.</p>

                <h3>Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)</h3>
                <p>PISA is not a framework but an international survey that evaluates education systems. It provides data to benchmark global education systems highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in the curriculum. Thus, it also helps policy-makers to improve educational standards and align various educational frameworks.</p>

                <h2>Most Common GPA to CGPA Conversion Scenarios</h2>
                <h3>U.S. GPA to CGPA Conversion (4.0 Scale)</h3>
                <p>The formula used is:</p>
                <p><strong>CGPA = GPA * 2.5</strong></p>
                <p>Thus, the conversions would be:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>4.0 GPA in CGPA is 10.0</li>
                    <li>3.5 GPA in CGPA is 8.75</li>
                    <li>3.0 GPA in CGPA is 7.5</li>
                    <li>2.0 GPA in CGPA is 5.0</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>U.S. GPA to CGPA (Indian) Conversion</h3>
                <p>There are certain Indian institutions that follow a different version of GPA (4.0 scale) to CGPA. The standard formula is:</p>
                <p><strong>CGPA = GPA * 9.5</strong></p>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
